# BuildMate - Starter Flutter App

This repository is a starter/demo Flutter project scaffold for the BuildMate app. It contains a minimal, well-structured app with screens for Login, Home, Post Job, Wallet and Chat — meant to be extended into a full production app.

## Features included in this starter
- Clean folder structure (lib/screens, lib/models, lib/services)
- Provider-based simple state management
- Placeholder Razorpay integration (configure API keys in services)
- Localization scaffolding using `intl`
- Placeholder location matching using `geolocator`
- Sample data and mock flows for job posting and wallet/escrow logic

## How to use
1. Install Flutter SDK (>= 3.0 recommended).
2. Run `flutter pub get` inside the project directory.
3. Open `lib/main.dart` and adjust configuration (Razorpay keys, backend endpoints).
4. For Android: configure AndroidManifest and add Razorpay keys as instructed in their docs.
5. Run the app: `flutter run`

This is a starter scaffold — it is intentionally lightweight and contains comments to help you extend it.
