Android / iOS platform notes:

- Razorpay requires platform-specific configuration. Add keys and permissions per package docs.
- For Android: update AndroidManifest with internet permission and optional meta-data for keys.
- For iOS: set up URL schemes and add required plist entries.
- Geolocation requires runtime permissions (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION on Android).

This starter intentionally leaves platform files minimal; follow packages' docs for integration steps.
